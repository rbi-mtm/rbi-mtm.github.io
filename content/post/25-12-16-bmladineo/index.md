On December 16 2025, **Bruno Mladineo** defended his **PhD thesis**:
<br>
**_Modelling of Complex Materials Using Machine-Learned Interatomic Potentials_**.

<!--more-->

Supervised by [Ivor Lončarić](/author/ivor-loncaric), Bruno employed machine-learned interatomic potentials to investigate organic molecular crystals with extreme anisotropic thermal expansion and thermosalient phase transitions, as well as femtosecond laser-induced dynamics of molecules on metallic surfaces.

In 2021, Bruno defended his master's thesis, also supervised by
[Ivor Lončarić](/author/ivor-loncaric/).
His master thesis dealt with the [_Structure and Properties of Two-Dimensional Dion-Jacobson Perovskites_](https://zir.nsk.hr/object/pmf:9732).

Bruno worked as a research assistant in our group
at the Ruđer Bošković Institute from 2021 to 2025.
He (co-)authored [six scientific publications](https://www.croris.hr/osobe/profil/40179).

**Bernhard Kretz, PhD** is a computational condensed matter physicist.

His research interests include the electronic ground- and excited-state properties of a variety of materials, ranging from molecules to 2D materials.
He primarily uses density functional theory (DFT), time-dependent DFT, and modern machine learning methods to study these systems.

During his career in academic research, he explored a variety of different materials, including [nano-porous graphene](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/full/10.1021/acs.inorgchem.5c01115), [metal-organic interfaces](https://advanced.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/advs.201400016), and [molecules](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/acs.jctc.0c00858).
Furthermore, he successfully collaborated with experimentalists, exploring the properties of [experimentally synthesized nano-porous graphene](https://www.science.org/doi/full/10.1126/science.aar2009) and [self-assembled monolayers](www.nature.com/articles/s41467-021-23528-8).

He also worked in the private sector for one year as project engineer for computational fluid dynamics.

Bernhard is a permanent staff member in the Modelling and Theory of Materials Group since 2026.

# Introduction
---

Welcome to the _Atomistic Modelling School 2025_ (**AMS25**)!

**AMS25** is a 3-day school, primarily intended to introduce theoretical concepts
and techniques employed in modern materials research.
The school aims to achieve this goal both through theoretical
lectures and practical hands-on sessions.

The primary intended audience for the school are **undergraduate students**; therefore, the only required knowledge to follow to school is a solid foundation in quantum physics. However, PhD students, postdocs and researchers in later career stages are **more than welcome**!

# Time & Location

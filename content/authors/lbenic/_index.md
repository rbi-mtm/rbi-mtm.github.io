**Luka Benić, Master of Physics** is a PhD student in theoretical Condensed Matter Physics.

He completed his Masters thesis in Physics under the mentorship of Associate Professor Ivica Smolić, under a title Teleparallel gravitation.
Currently he is pursuing his PhD in theoretical Condensed Matter Physics and is working on developing and applying Machine Learning methods to study different properties of monolayer Transition metal dichalcogenides, such as NbSe<sub>2</sub> and TiSe<sub>2</sub>. His [most recent work](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.jctc.5c00959) studied the finite electronic temperature effects in a monolayer NbSe<sub>2</sub>.

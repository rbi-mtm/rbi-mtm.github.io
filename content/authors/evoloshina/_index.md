**Elena Voloshina, Dr. habil.** is a theoretical condensed matter physicist.

Her research is focused on the electronic and magnetic properties of different low-dimensional objects, particularly two-dimensional (2D) materials and systems on their basis. For her contributions to this field she was recognised with the Shanghai 1000 Talent award (2018). Before joining RBI, she worked at leading universities and research institutes in Germany (2002-2017) and China (2017-2024). Further details can be found [here](https://condmat.prof).

Elena is a permanent staff member of the Modelling and Theory of Materials Group since 2024.

**Juraj Ovčar, PhD** is a theoretical condensed matter physicist.

His general research interest is developing and employing methodologies required
to model physical systems from an atomistic perspective. He is especially interested
in collaboration with experimentalists to arrive at complete understanding of real physical phenomena.

He worked on a diverse range of systems, including [quasi-2D hybrid halide perovskites](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/acs.chemmater.1c03815),
[catalyst surfaces](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/full/10.1021/acs.jctc.1c00347), [mitochondrial membranes](https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlelanding/2024/ob/d4ob00252k) and [{{< math >}}$\kappa${{< /math >}}-type quantum spin liquid candidates](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14034).

He also enjoys developing [free and open-source software](https://github.com/rbi-mtm/).

Juraj is a permanent staff member of the Modelling and Theory of Materials Group since 2025.

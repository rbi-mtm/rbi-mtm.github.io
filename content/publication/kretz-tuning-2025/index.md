abstract: Different nanoporous graphene structures have shown great promise for a
  wide variety of applications. However, due to limitations in experimental or computational
  throughput, nanoporous graphenes have not been investigated systematically. In this
  work, we combine density functional theory and machine learning to study 460 structures
  of nanoporous graphene made from four different templates. We shed light on structure-band
  gap relations and perform molecular dynamics simulations and phonon calculations
  in order to determine the role of electron--phonon coupling on the renormalization
  of temperature-dependent band gaps. Our results uncover that certain subsets of
  nanoporous graphene exhibit a similar trend in the band gap as a function of a structural
  parameter as has been observed for armchair graphene nanoribbons. Furthermore, we
  find that electron--phonon coupling varies over a large range in the investigated
  nanoporous graphenes and that it drives the closing of the band gap with larger
  temperatures. Finally, we suggest nanoporous graphene structures for different applications,
  such as field-effect transistors. Thus, our work can help guide the development
  and improvement of nanoporous graphene-based devices.

**Radovan Matula** is a PhD student in the field of theoretical condensed matter physics.

His research interests include ab intio modelling of materials, primarily with density functional theory. For his PhD research he is exploring the use of machine learning techniques to improve sytem-size and temporal scaling of DFT. 

He started his work with DFT during his bachelor thesis, when he worked on modelling the band structure of [CsPbBr3 perovskite](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/full/10.1021/acs.jpcc.3c03056) in tandem with experimental research. He continued to his master's combining DFT with machine learning to study the halide exchange in lead mixed-halide perovskites. He continues to build on his previous experiences during his PhD.

Radovan is a PhD student in the Modelling and Theory of Materials Group since 2025.

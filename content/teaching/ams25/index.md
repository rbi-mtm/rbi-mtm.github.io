# Introduction
---

Welcome to the _Atomistic Modelling School 2025_ (**AMS25**)!

**AMS25** is a 3-day school, primarily intended to introduce theoretical concepts
and techniques employed in modern materials research.
The school aims to achieve this goal both through theoretical
lectures and practical hands-on sessions.

The primary intended audience for the school are **undergraduate students**; therefore, the only knowledge required to follow to school is a solid foundation in quantum physics. However, PhD students, postdocs and researchers in later career stages are **more than welcome**!

More details are given below:

- [Scope and format](#scope--format) of the school

# Time & Location
---

The school will be held on three Wednesdays in December:

- December 3 2025, 09:00 - 17:00
- December 10 2025, 09:00 - 17:00
- December 17 2025, 09:00 - 17:00

in the **lecture hall** of the [**Institute of Physics**](https://maps.app.goo.gl/SigjffQmq9kXdW2n9) (Zagreb, Croatia). Detailed instructions on how to enter the Institute and arrive to the hall will be added.

# Application
---

Take a couple of minutes and apply: [**Click here to open the application form**](https://forms.gle/zzKY9goW9B85c6m78).

The application deadline is **November 9 2025, 23:59**.

School attendance is **free** for all participants.

# Schedule

The schedule will be announced soon.

# Scope & Format
---

It is possible to understand, explain and predict physical phenomena
related to macroscopic systems by modelling and analyzing
the behavior of their microscopic constituent elements (**atoms**).
In the last century, a wide variety of [atomistic modelling methods](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computational_materials_science#Comparison_of_methods),
primarily founded in **quantum physics**, were developed.
Theoretical frameworks, computational methods and the software/hardware infrastructure
related to atomistic modelling have been rapidly advancing,
resulting in time and length scales available to modern simulations
being comparable to experiments.

It is the aim of this school to introduce some such methods
and contextualize them within modern science, so that the
participants gain a broad perspective on the state of the art
of **computational materials science** and are able to
more easily continue learning.

The topics covered by the school include:

- An introduction to [crystallography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crystal_structure)
- [Density functional theory](https://arxiv.org/abs/cond-mat/0211443)
- Phonons and electron-phonon coupling
- [Molecular dynamics](https://tinyurl.com/p9w94vmv)
- [Machine learning in materials science](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S135902862400055X)
- A practical perspective on guiding and explaining experiments via simulations

Gaining a comprehensive understanding of different methodologies requires
both an understanding of theoretical foundations and a certain level of practical experience.
Therefore, each day of **AMS25** will consist of **3 theoretical lectures** in the morning,
followed by **3 hands-on sessions** in the afternoon.

Read about the [hands-on sessions](#hands-on-sessions) and check the [schedule](#schedule) for more details.

We will also organize an **open panel discussion** about working in computational materials science.

# Hands-on sessions
---

Before the school, we will provide each participant with a [virtual machine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_machine) (VM),
containing all the software necessary to follow the hands-on sessions.

The participants will then be able to execute all exercises on their own laptops.

{{% callout note %}}
To participate in the hands-on sessions,
you need to bring your own laptop. If you do not have a laptop and wish
to attend the hands-on sessions, send an email to <Juraj.Ovcar@irb.hr>.

# Organization
---

**AMS25** is organized by the members of the [**Modelling and Theory of Materials Group**](/people)
at the [Ruđer Bošković institute](https://www.irb.hr/eng).

We are grateful to the [Institute of Physics](https://ifs.hr/) for providing the lecture hall for the school.

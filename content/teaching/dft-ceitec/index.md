# About
___

This was a 2-day workshop on [density functional theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Density_functional_theory) (**DFT**) that Ivor and Juraj held at [CEITEC BUT](https://www.ceitec.eu/) in February, 2022.

The workshop consisted of theoretical lectures in the morning and hands-on exercises in [Quantum ESPRESSO](https://www.quantum-espresso.org/) in the afternoon.

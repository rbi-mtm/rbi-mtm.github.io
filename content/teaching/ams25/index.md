# Introduction
---

Welcome to the _Atomistic Modelling School 2025_ (**AMS25**)!

**AMS25** is a 3-day school, primarily intended to introduce theoretical concepts
and techniques employed in modern materials research.
The school aims to achieve this goal both through theoretical
lectures and practical hands-on sessions.

The primary intended audience for the school are **undergraduate students**; therefore, the only knowledge required to follow to school is a solid foundation in quantum physics. However, PhD students, postdocs and researchers in later career stages are **more than welcome**!

More details are given below:

- [Scope and format](#scope--format) of the school
- [Schedule](#schedule)


# Time & Location
---

The school will be held on three Wednesdays in December:

- December 3 2025, 09:00 - 17:00
- December 10 2025, 09:00 - 17:00
- December 17 2025, 09:00 - 17:00

in the **lecture hall** of the [**Institute of Physics**](https://maps.app.goo.gl/SigjffQmq9kXdW2n9) (Zagreb, Croatia). Detailed instructions on how to enter the Institute and arrive to the hall will be added.

# Application

Take a couple of minutes and apply: [**Click here to open the application form**](https://forms.gle/zzKY9goW9B85c6m78).

The application deadline is **November 9 2025, 23:59**.

School attendance is **free** for all attendants.

# Scope & Format
---

It is possible to understand, explain and predict physical phenomena
related to macroscopic systems by modelling and analyzing
the behavior of their microscopic constituent elements (**atoms**).
In the last century, a wide variety of [atomistic modelling methods](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computational_materials_science#Comparison_of_methods),
primarily founded in **quantum physics**, were developed.
Theoretical frameworks, computational methods and the software/hardware infrastructure
related to atomistic modelling have been rapidly advancing,
resulting in time and length scales available to modern simulations
being comparable to experiments.

It is the aim of this school to introduce some such methods
and contextualize them within modern science, so that the
attendees gain a broad perspective on the state of the art
of **computational materials science** and are able to
more easily continue learning.

The topics covered by the school include:

- An introduction to [crystallography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crystal_structure)
- [Density functional theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Density_functional_theory)
- [Classical interatomic potentials](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interatomic_potential)
- [Molecular dynamics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecular_dynamics)
- Guiding and understanding experiments via simulations
- more to be added...
